In this project, I made all the automation in Google Chrome (version 87.0.4280.88). If this webdriver does not work that means you have a different version of Google Chrome. Please go to About Google Chrome and check your version (it is recommended to update your browser to the latest version). If you have a different version please go to [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads] and download the webdriver according to your browser version. After you download the new version, place the file in this folder, and delete the old webdriver. If you want to use a different browser you will have to download the webdriver for that browser and you might have to edit some part of the code.
